# Exercise Instructions

Before you get started, make sure you run `./bin/setup` to install gems
and set up your database.

You're going to want to do a few things to the existing controller code:

All public methods should be as RESTful as possible
Make sure the only logic that lives in your controller is related to handling your requests and responses
Apply other techniques from previous exercises and tutorials to clean up this controller as much as possible
Make sure to write tests for any new classes you create during this exercise.

Also, make sure all tests pass before submitting by running `rake`.
